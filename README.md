# Project Title
Members-Only
## Description

The project is a simple web application called "Members Only Club" designed to emulate a community platform for fans of an old MMORPG game. It allows users to register, log in, and access exclusive content once they become members by entering a secret code.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can register for an account and log in securely.
- **Membership Access:** After logging in, users can access exclusive content reserved for members only ( members can see post authors and time stamp).
- **Secret Code:** Users must enter a secret code to become members and access exclusive content (it's "kitty").
- **Message Posting:** Members can post messages to the community board.

## Usage
* Register for an account if you're a new user.
* Log in using your credentials.
* To become a member and access exclusive content, enter the secret code.
* Once logged in as a member, you can post messages to the community board.

## Technologies Used
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Passport.js (for authentication)
* MongoDB (or your preferred database)
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
* Pug (Template engine)
